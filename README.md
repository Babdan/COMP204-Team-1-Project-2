<h1>  🧩 COMP204 Team 1 Project 2  </h1>
 
- Tetris 2048 is a game that combines elements of the classic Tetris game with the popular 2048 game. We will write this game in Java programming language and uses the StdDraw library for graphical rendering.
- The objective of the game is to stack falling shapes called tetrominoes in a way that forms complete rows. When a row is completed, it disappears and the player earns points. 
- The game is won when the player reaches a score of 2048, similar to the original 2048 game. However, the game is over if the player runs out of space to stack the falling shapes.
- The game is played on a 10x20 grid, and the shapes fall from the top of the grid toward the bottom. The player can move the shapes left or right, rotate them, or drop them down faster. 
-The shapes come in seven different varieties, each with a different shape and color.
- The game also features a scoring system, which rewards players for completing rows and reaching certain milestones.
-As the player's score increases, the game becomes more challenging with faster-falling shapes.
- The game is implemented using Java and the StdDraw library, which provides a simple interface for drawing shapes and text on a canvas. The game logic is implemented using object-oriented programming concepts, with separate classes for the game board, tetrominoes, and game state.
